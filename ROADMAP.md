# Roadmap — Pawvy 🗺

This document is the living plan for Pawvy. It tracks where we've been and where we're going.

## ✅ Completed Phases (Archived)

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | Project Foundation (Node/Express/SQLite) |
| Phase 2 | Frontend MVP (React + Kanban) |
| Phase 3 | UI Redesign (Tailwind, Asana-ish) |
| Phase 4-7 | UI Polish (bulk actions, shortcuts, saved views, responsive) |
| Phase 8 | Multi-Project Hub (auto-discovery, cross-project) |
| Phase 9 | Backend Clean Architecture (TypeScript, services, repos) |
| Phase 10 | Frontend Clean Architecture (page-centered structure) |

## 🚧 Phase 11: OpenClaw Integration (Completed ✅)

*Making Pawvy "Just Work" with OpenClaw.*

### Documentation

See `docs/` for detailed guides:
- [`docs/openclaw-integration.md`](docs/openclaw-integration.md) — WebSocket, webhook system, agent component
- [`docs/openclaw-auto-detect.md`](docs/openclaw-auto-detect.md) — Auto-detect workspace, agent discovery
- [`docs/auto-generate-api-key.md`](docs/auto-generate-api-key.md) — Auto-generated API key mechanism
- [`docs/pawvy-agent-plugin.md`](docs/pawvy-agent-plugin.md) — Native plugin for accurate agent lifecycle tracking

### Features Delivered

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Auto-detect OpenClaw workspace | ✅ |
| Auto-generate and store API key | ✅ |
| Activity-reporting skill | ✅ |
| Real-time session stream (WebSocket) | ✅ |
| Agent presence display | ✅ |
| Native OpenClaw plugin for lifecycle | ✅ |

### Native Plugin for Real-Time Agent Status

Replaced the external `pawvy-pulse` hook with a native OpenClaw plugin (`pawvy-agent`) that subscribes to agent lifecycle events via `api.on()`:

- `before_agent_start` → Thinking (modifying hook — 3s fetch timeout so it never delays agents)
- `agent_end` + idle timer → Idle
- `session_start` → Idle (if not mid-run)
- `gateway_start` / `gateway_stop` → Online / Offline

Plugin loads directly from `extensions/pawvy-agent/` via `plugins.load.paths` — no copy step needed. Uses `api.logger` so lifecycle events appear in `openclaw logs`. See [`docs/pawvy-agent-plugin.md`](docs/pawvy-agent-plugin.md) for full details and debug guide.

### Known Issues (Phase 11.1)

- [ ] **Agent not updating in UI** — WebSocket connection issue
  - Frontend connects to `ws://localhost:5173/ws` but needs `ws://localhost:3001/ws`
  - Fix: Set `VITE_WS_BASE=ws://localhost:3001/ws` in frontend environment
  - Alternative: Use Vite proxy (`/ws` → backend) - not working correctly
- [ ] **Frontend tests** — Added `AgentStatusRow.test.tsx` for UI testing
- [x] **Webhook field mapping** — Fixed to handle `agentId`/`event` fields correctly

## 🚧 Phase 12: Real-Time Awareness (Medium Priority)

*See what agents are doing, as they do it.*

### Checklist

#### 3. Real-Time Session Stream
- [x] OpenClaw emits events via internal hooks (command:new, message:received, etc.)
- [x] Pawvy webhook receives events
- [ ] Frontend receives WebSocket broadcast — **BLOCKED by Phase 11.1 WebSocket issue**

#### 4. Context Awareness
- [ ] Show "Tee is working on task #75"
- [ ] Link sessions to tasks automatically
- [ ] Branch/worktree context in activity feed

---

## 🎯 Phase 13: Active Docs (Lower Priority)

*Transform Docs from passive file list to active participant.*

### Checklist

#### 5. Task-Doc Linkage
- [ ] Attach "Reference Docs" to a Task

#### 6. Doc Intelligence
- [ ] Agent-generated summaries (TL;DR)
- [ ] Stale Doc Alerts: flag outdated docs vs recent code changes
- [ ] Milestone Events: promote Vision/Roadmap updates to high-priority activity

---

## 🧪 Validation Track (Deferred)

Testing and debugging — deferred until Phase 11 stabilizes.

- [ ] Expand backend unit tests (Vitest): tasks, projects, activities, docs
- [ ] Run backend smoke test + API health
- [ ] Add Playwright E2E (drag/drop + keyboard flows)
- [ ] Manual UI regression: board load, drag/drop, create/edit task, project switch, activity feed
- [ ] Verify VS Code debugging configs (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Fix any regressions found

---

## Open Questions

- Advanced search operators: `assignee:tee status:done` syntax
- Deploy sync strategy: `git pull` vs `reset --hard`
